# Task 2: Maximum
# Your goal for this task is to set a register to the 
# maximum of two registers
# The A and B registers will be initialized with
# arbitrary values
# The C register should hold the maximum of A and B

# Note that the initial values for A and B are just
# an example.
# Your code should work for any values of A and B
A: 5; # Initialize the A register to 5
B: 7; # Initialize the B register to 7
C: 0; # Initialize the C register to 0 - DO NOT CHANGE

# Goal:
#
#   C = MAX(A, B)
#
# If A = 3 and B = 4, then C = 4
# If A = 2 and B = -3, then C = 2
# If A = 5 and B = 5, then C = 5

# IF statements in VMAL:
# If you wanted to implment the following C code in VMAL,
#
#   if (A == 0) {
#     // STUFF
#   }
#
# then the resulting VMAL would look something as follows:
#
#   SF A;
#   BIZ IF_START_1;
#   GO IF_END_1;
#   LBL IF_START_1;
#   // STUFF (translated to VMAL)
#   LBL IF_END_1;
#
# In order to do conditional statements with VMAL, you are
# going to have to be creative!

# Note: if you want to use BIN or BIZ, you must first 
# do the SF operation to set the N and Z flags.

# Start your code here
